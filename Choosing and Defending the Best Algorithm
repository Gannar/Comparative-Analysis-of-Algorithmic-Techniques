**** Comparison of Approaches

** The Greedy algorithm is significantly faster because it runs in
O(n log n) time due to sorting, while brute-force runs in O(2ⁿ) time, which is infeasible for large inputs.


**The greedy solution is easier to maintain:
Fewer lines of code
No recursion or backtracking
Predictable performance

** Memory trade-offs :
Greedy: O(n) memory (sorted list + result)
Brute-force: O(n) stack depth but extremely high CPU cost


✅ Use the Greedy Algorithm

Reasons:
Handles thousands of tasks per second
Produces an optimal solution
Simple, scalable, and reliable


**** Final Conclusion
For a real-time delivery backend system, the Greedy earliest-finish-time algorithm is the only practical and scalable solution.
Brute-force is computationally infeasible and should not be used in production.
